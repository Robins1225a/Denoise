# ECG Signal Denoising using EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition)

This project demonstrates how to denoise an ECG (electrocardiogram) signal using **Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)**. The method decomposes the noisy signal into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) and reconstructs a cleaner version by removing the noise-dominant IMFs.

## üìå Overview

- **Input**: Clean ECG signal + simulated Gaussian noise (SNR = 10 dB)
- **Process**:
  - Perform EMD to extract IMFs
  - Discard the first few IMFs (assumed to capture high-frequency noise)
  - Reconstruct the denoised signal from the remaining IMFs
- **Output**: Denoised ECG signal
